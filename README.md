trips in the early morning.
- Trips with airport rate, especially in JFK Airport Rate, are of higher average revenue, and the
highest revenue per mile/minute. Such case also applies to dispatch trips, which is likely to be a
negotiated fare. However, such type of trips only constitute less than 2% of the total trips.

rides during off-peak hours (at night and early morning) and more during the day.
